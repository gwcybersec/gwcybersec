- 👋 Hi, I’m Garry
- 👀 I’m interested in various security related opensource projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to put together a system that utilizes various opensource projects for small companies that may not have dedicated security personnel or bugets for their security needs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Github with my company (soon to be released).
- 📫 How to reach me: garry@gwcybersec.com
